        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>We are a group of crazy, fun-loving, and adventurous teens who want to share our campus experiences with you. From the highs to the lows, the laughter to the tears, we'll take you on a rollercoaster ride of campus life in Kenya.<br>
        As a group of adventurous and fun-loving teenagers, we have experienced all kinds of highs and lows on our campus journey in Kenya. From the excitement of exploring a new campus to the challenges of making new friends and adjusting to the academic demands of college, our experiences have been diverse and exciting.
<br>
            <br>
            One of our most memorable experiences was when we decided to organize a campus event to raise funds for charity. We spent weeks planning and preparing for the event, and it turned out to be a huge success. Our fellow students came out in droves to support us, and we raised more money than we ever thought possible. It was an incredible feeling to see the impact we could have when we worked together for a common cause.
            <br>
            <br>

            Of course, not all our experiences have been positive. There have been times when we've struggled with homesickness, academic pressure, and the stress of exams. One of our friends even failed a major exam and had to repeat a semester, which was tough for her to deal with. But we've always been there for each other, offering support and encouragement when we needed it most.
<br>
            <br>
            Along the way, we've also had our fair share of fun and adventures. We've explored the local town, gone on camping trips, and even tried bungee jumping. We've made lifelong memories and friendships that will stay with us long after we leave campus.
<br>
            <br>
            In short, our campus journey has been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, laughter and tears, but we wouldn't trade it for anything. It's shaped us into the people we are today, and we're grateful for every experience – good or bad – that we've had along the way.</p>
